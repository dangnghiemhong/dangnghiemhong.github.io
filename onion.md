# The “Onion” Method: Build Your SOP from the Core Out

Think of your SOP as an onion:

- At the **core**, you have 1–3 key messages you want the committee to remember about you  
  (e.g., “I have strong research potential in bioinformatics and a clear plan to connect AI and healthcare.”)

- Around this core, you build **layers**:
  - A short intro that hints at the core
  - One or two paragraphs on how your interest evolved
  - Evidence: projects, research, internships, independent work
  - How this specific program is the right next step
  - Your short- and long-term goals

Every paragraph should **support or illustrate** those core messages.  
If a sentence doesn’t connect back to them, consider deleting it.
