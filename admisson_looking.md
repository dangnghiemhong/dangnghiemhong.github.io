# What Admissions Committees Really Look For

Your SOP is not just a "personal statement". Committees mainly want to know:

1. **You can do the work.**  
   They look for evidence from your coursework, projects, research, and any independent work that shows you can handle graduate-level material.

2. **You will finish the program and do well.**  
   They care about consistency, resilience, and realistic goals—someone who can survive the hard parts and still finish strong.

3. **You are good to work with.**  
   In grad school, professors work closely with you. They want students who are responsible, respectful, and pleasant collaborators, not drama generators.

4. **You will be a valuable alumnus.**  
   They want to invest in people who will use the degree well, grow in their careers, and reflect positively on the program later.

Your SOP is where you give *meaning* to the numbers in your transcript and CV:  
**Why** you chose certain paths, **how** you responded to challenges, and **what** you plan to do with the degree.
