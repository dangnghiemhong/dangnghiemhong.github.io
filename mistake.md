# Common SOP Mistakes to Avoid

- **Just repeating your CV.**  
  Listing your GPA, ranks, and awards again wastes space—they already saw those. Use the SOP to explain the *story* behind these achievements instead.

- **Writing a childhood superhero origin story.**  
  Long stories about what you did at age 3 or 6 rarely help. Focus on college and later, where your choices are more relevant and believable.

- **Whining about your circumstances.**  
  Briefly explaining real context (illness, family issues, etc.) is fine, especially if it helps interpret your grades. But endless complaints sound like excuses and suggest you might struggle with a rigorous program.

- **Ignoring the prompt or the word limit.**  
  Not answering the question or going way over the limit signals you don’t read instructions carefully—this can be an instant red flag.

- **Trying to sound like a saint.**  
  Saying you want to “save the world” is fine only if supported by your actual actions. Don’t claim things you can’t back up.

- **Copy-pasting the same essay for every school.**  
  Each program has its own questions and emphasis. A generic essay (or worse: the wrong school name) shows a lack of seriousness.
